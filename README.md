# horiseon-code-refactor

## Overview

Horiseo is a marketing agency focused on SEO for clients across different industries. The purpose of this website is to showcase the skills and services that Horiseo can provide. That said, the website was due for a website audit to make sure that it was up-to-date with website standards for ADA compliance and SEO.

## Code Refactor

There were quite a few issues with the original code for this website that I was able to refactor to standard.

SITE TITLE - the site title was originally generic. I updated this to "Horiseon Social Solution Services" - the company name.

SEMANTIC ELEMENTS - I added elements for the header, navigation, sections, aside, and the footer. This helped break the page into organized sections versus having all sections labeled as div tags.

ALT TAGS - alt tags for images were added. Alt tags provide details about each image and help the website with ADA compliance.

ELEMENT STRUCTURE - In the CSS I arranged the elements to be in a logical structure (elements, classes, ids). Originally all elements in the document were divs. I was able to consolidate and clean up the code to include ids and specific sections. I commented all the sections in the code.

## Takeaways

Overall this project was more challenging than I anticipated. I did my best to clean up the code and make it easier to read so that it can be scalable for future projects. I also focused on making this site optimized for SEO.
